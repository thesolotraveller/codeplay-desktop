`Introductory notes`

`Why`
Wrote this app 2 years back in a 2 weeks sprint as part of R&D for some other big project. While on one hand never used it in the main project, there are some good parts baked in this which can fun to look at in the free time for learning purposed. Flagship one being the tree view project (files) explorer. I am making this open source with the intent that it might help someone someday with something.
